# Reversi
## Rules
## Gamestate File
A reversi gamestate file is structured like this:  
`i k d`  
`i` being the number of the player who is next to move. These numbers start counting at 0.  
`k` is the total amount of players in the game.  
`d` being the dimensions of the board. In a standard game of reversi this is 2.
